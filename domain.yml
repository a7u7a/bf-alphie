            There was a little child who really loved dolls. They had a big
            collection of them in their bedroom. One day, while they were
            browsing  in a shop, they spotted a really beautiful doll. It would 
            make a perfect addition to their collection. They only hoped they 
            had  enough money to buy it.

            “How much is that doll?”, the child  asked the old woman behind the
            counter. “This doll is not for sale”, replied the woman. “But it’s
            so beautiful”, said the child. “I really want it.” The old woman
            became irritated. “I told you, it’s not for sale”, she said. “Why
            not?”, persisted the the child. “Because this doll is cursed!”
            “Well... That’s OK. I don’t mind.” “I’m not going to sell it to
            you... But if you really must have it, go  ahead and take it. It’s
            yours. But if something bad happens, don’t blame  me.” “Ah! Yes,
            thank you!” said the child, smiling as they grabbed the doll and
            walked out of the shop."

            The little child was so delighted to get the doll for free that
            they  ran all the way home, carrying it in their arms. When they got
            home to their block of flats they went into the hall way. It was
            deserted and the lightbulbs were flickering. The child stood  there
            waiting for the lift to arrive. The doors opened and the child
            stepped inside, clutching their new doll tightly.The doors closed,
            but the elevator did not move.The little child got scared and began
            trembling with fear. “OMG”, they thought to themselves “Is this the
            curse of the doll?”

            Suddenly, they felt the doll move in their arms. Ever so slowly, its
            head turned to face the child. The little child wanted to scream but
            they couldn’t make a sound. The doll’s eyelids fluttered and opened.
            It stared at the child with it's lifeless glass eyes and in a
            demonic voice the doll said, "Press the button to go up, idiot."
